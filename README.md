# 2048-Solver-using-TD-Learning
RL Final Project


Created an RL agent for 2048 game based on Temporal-Difference Learning and Multi-Stage Temporal- Difference Learning Algorithms.

**Result:** The agent was to able to converge to 2048 much faster than humans and showing a better performance with the Multi-Stage Temporal Learning Algorithm.
